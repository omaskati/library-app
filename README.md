# library-app

An Odin Project assignment:

The beginning stages of a personal Library app that allows you to add and remove books, providing specific info for each entry, as well as indicating which ones the user has read or not read yet.

The goal is to practice manipulating the DOM using javascript. As I continue in the course, I hope to come back to this and add more functionality, like sorting functions.
